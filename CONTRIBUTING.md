# Contributing to Spring Boot REST API Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 120 characters
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add appropriate comments and documentation

## Testing Guidelines

1. Write unit tests for new features
2. Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
3. Include both positive and negative test cases
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Follow the existing test structure

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the docs/DESIGN.md if you're changing core functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer

## Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)
